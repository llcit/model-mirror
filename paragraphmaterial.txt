It’s a faulty assumption that you can explain a math strategy verbally and students will get it—but educators “cannot simply tell a student to understand,” Kling and Bay-Williams write. More important, students need time and experiences to understand and visualize number relationships, not just a good explanation.
Make liberal use of visual strategies, the researchers say. One fun activity is to use Quick Look cards: Briefly show students groups of several dots—or photos of familiar items like a carton of eggs—and then ask them how many they saw and how they saw them. For example, did students see four groups of two or two groups of four? Seeing numbers represented visually, whether with dots or manipulatives, can help students gain a better understanding of how and why math strategies work.
Or you could try Splat!, designed by Steve Wyborney, a K–12 district math coach in Oregon. Using a series of slides, he first asks his students to count the number of dots they see. He then shows the next slide, which suddenly has a large amoeboid blob covering several dots, and asks, “How many dots have been covered by the splat?” Students often come up with their own strategies—whether counting up or down, or using their voice or fingers.
A common approach is to teach addition and multiplication facts in order of addend or factor size—starting with 0s, and then moving to 1s, then 2s, and 3s, for example, when learning the times tables. But that’s a mistake, because students then tend to see mathematical “facts as isolated objects,” write Kling and Bay-Williams, which can result in a superficial understanding of mathematical operations and ultimately reduce a student’s level of achievement. 
They point to research showing that starting with foundational sets—2s, 10s, and 5s—is not only more familiar to students but also vital because other math facts can be derived from them. For example, once a student learns their 5s, they can break down challenging problems—such as 8 x 7—into 8 x 5 plus 8 x 2, and also tackle more daunting problems like 56 x 8. After mastering the foundational sets, students should move on to squares (7 x 7) “because some of the toughest facts to learn (e.g., 7 × 8 and 6 × 7) are close to squares, and squares are useful for later work in algebra, geometry, and measurement.”
