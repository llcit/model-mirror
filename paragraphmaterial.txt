When scientists looked at the stars long ago, they saw patterns. They did not
understand everything about what they saw, so they kept looking in order to learn more.
That is what scientists do. They ask questions and search for information to answer their
questions. They are similar to explorers. While they do not travel far the way explorers do,
they do make a kind of journey. Scientists want to learn more, so their journey is to travel
from what they know to what they discover.
 Scientists have learned many facts about our planet. They’ve discovered that it is
incredibly diverse, with many different kinds of environments. There are both places that
are extremely hot and spots that are freezing. There are mountains and plains, hills and
valleys. There are deep oceans and there are great rivers and waterfalls. There are
tropical rainforests and arid deserts. Those are all various parts of our planet. Still, there
is much more to learn about what is here on Earth, particularly what is under the oceans.
Scientists still are exploring this planet. A scientist dedicates much time to learning, first
how to research, then using those skills to learn about the world. The scientist works hard
to help us all become more knowledgeable about our world. Research is the key to learning
more.
Our planet is in a galaxy called the Milky Way. The sun is a big star in our part of
this giant galaxy, but our galaxy holds millions of other stars. The sun is very important to
our planet because it provides light during the day, and gives us heat, too. Two other
planets are closer to the sun than Earth: Mercury and Venus. Each planet has its own
characteristics. We have learned more about them by studying the solar system with
telescopes and spacecraft. Unmanned spacecraft have taken scientific instruments as far
away as the planet Mars. There they found similarities to Earth, including kinds of land
formations such as mountains as well as other features, and a landscape that seems to be
the same rocky surface on most of that red planet, but they have not found any lifeforms on
that barren planet.
 Scientists figured out how the Earth changes. Earth orbits the sun once each year,
which means it travels once around the sun every 365 days. The other eight planets in our
solar system also orbit around the sun. All travel in a pattern called an ellipse, which is a
type of oval. Therefore, at times, Earth is farther from the sun. Scientists figured out that
the farther Earth was from the sun, the cooler the planet was. They also figured out that it
is the tilt of the Earth’s axis, however, that has the greatest effect on temperatures.
 Scientists are still learning about our galaxy. There will always be new things to
discover. Today astronauts travel into space, they are explorers. Long ago, explorers used
to travel the sea and map places no one had been before. Now, astronauts travel in ships—
spacecraft--thousands of miles in space, where still much is unknown. While it is
dangerous to travel in space, astronauts are dauntless and bravely travel thousands of
miles just to learn. They bring skills with technology and research and courage to their
work.
