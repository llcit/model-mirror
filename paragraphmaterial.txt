Typically, a cycle of noh theater comprises a sacred invocation, or okina, five plays, and two comic interludes called kyogen (mad words). In the okina, a dancer symbolizes the descent of a god by donning an okina mask – the face of a wizened old man – and performs a kamigaku (divine dance). Another then breaks into a sanbaso – a lively dance with leaps, stamps, and the shaking of bells to send the god off royally. A kyogen is a short comic duet or trio that has antecedents in the humorous form of sarugaku. These interludes involve zany situations, such as a master-servant relationship in which a servant tricks his lord out of sake or sugar, or avoids hard work. Other objects of ridicule are bumbling priests, blind men, or unfaithful husbands. Bridegrooms are also targeted. In Futari-Bakama (Two in One Pair of Trousers), a groom and his father pay a visit to his fiancée’s family. Although they only have one pair of formal trousers, they are anxious to make a good impression, so each man occupies a pant leg. The first of the five plays is called kami-mono (god play) and involves a deity who descends to bestow blessings on mortals. The second is shura-mono (warrior play) involving a fallen hero, while in the third type, kazura-mono (woman play), a lovelorn female is wronged or abandoned by her lover. The fourth is monoguri-mono (madness play) in which the protagonist, often a woman, is driven to a deranged state by extreme duress or jealousy. Lastly, in the faster-paced kiri-mono (demon play), evil beings preside, or sometimes magical animals. Spectators follow scripts, since the archaic language chanted by the chorus is often incomprehensible to modern Japanese audiences.
