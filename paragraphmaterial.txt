Wilson lived in a small village in Kenya, in the
eastern part of Africa. Even though he was
only a ten year old boy, he was an important
member of his family. His family raised cows
and goats. He was given the job of watching
the goats. Wilsonâ€™s family did not have many
other possessions. They drank the milk from
the goats and cows, and sold them when
they needed money. If the cattle died, they
knew that their family might not survive.
Wilson was proud that his father trusted
him with the goats. It was a dangerous job
because lions roamed around and attacked
the herds. Wilson had to be ready to face a
lion, if necessary. His father taught him to be
brave so that he could protect the goats and
his family. He had a spear that was taller than he was. Wilson was very skilled at throwing
the spear.
One day he was sitting on a rock, watching the goats, and he heard something in the bushes.
A lion was moving slowly toward one of the goats. Wilson knew that he had to be brave.
He thought about what he had learned from his father. He sat quietly, waiting for the right
moment. He knew that if he did the wrong thing, the lion would kill him. Wilson lifted his
spear and moved quietly toward the lion. When the lion saw him he looked him in the eye.
They both froze. Wilson remembered all that his father had told him about being brave.
He knew that he could throw his spear and kill the lion. Suddenly the lion turned away and
disappeared over the rocks. Wilson stood strong and watched. After the danger passed he
took a deep breath. He felt the sun on his face and put down his spear. Wilson knew that he
could take care of the people in his family and his tribe.
