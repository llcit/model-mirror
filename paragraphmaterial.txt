One of the most incredible trees in the
world is known as the baobab. It is native to
several parts of the world, including South
Africa and Australia. Sometimes, it is hard
to tell what the name of a tree is because
they tend to look like each other. This is not
a problem with the baobab. Its appearance
is quite distinct, so no one can mistake it for
another tree. The baobab is extremely wide
at the base, so people often take shelter
under it. One Australian baobab was so
large that people were able to turn part of
the tree into a small room. Prisoners were
kept inside the tree room as a resting place
when they were transported to the city. The
tree itself was so strong and wide that it
could hold a large group of people. The tree
is now estimated to be 1,500 years old, and despite being used as a holding chamber, it is
still thriving.
The baobabs are also called monkey bread trees. They have edible fruits and leaves. The
treeâ€™s fruit is very delicious and is a tasty treat that is eaten in many African countries. The
fruits have also been found to be very healthy. They are full of vitamins and minerals. People
make porridge and flavor soft drinks from the fruit. The leaves are used by some people to
make a nutritious soup. Since the tree grows in dry environments, it has to store water. The
tree soaks in water during wet seasons. During dry spells, it is able to use the water it has
stored away. Some baobabs can store thousands of gallons of water. Of course, the baobabs
also provide the people of sunny South Africa with some shade during hot African days.
