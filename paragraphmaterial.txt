Backstage, the shite dramatically transforms via mask, wig, and costume into a drastically different guise, from an old man into a gallant young god, or from a beautiful young woman into the ghost of a warrior. In the meantime, the waki meets a local person, a comedic kyogen actor called the ai. In cruder jargon, the ai confirms the legend of the death and suggests that the waki pray for the ghost he has just encountered. The shite will then reappear, transformed.
Typically, a cycle of noh theater comprises a sacred invocation, or okina, five plays, and two comic interludes called kyogen (mad words). In the okina, a dancer symbolizes the descent of a god by donning an okina mask – the face of a wizened old man – and performs a kamigaku (divine dance). Another then breaks into a sanbaso – a lively dance with leaps, stamps, and the shaking of bells to send the god off royally. A kyogen is a short comic duet or trio that has antecedents in the humorous form of sarugaku. These interludes involve zany situations, such as a master-servant relationship in which a servant tricks his lord out of sake or sugar, or avoids hard work. Other objects of ridicule are bumbling priests, blind men, or unfaithful husbands. Bridegrooms are also targeted. In Futari-Bakama (Two in One Pair of Trousers), a groom and his father pay a visit to his fiancée’s family. Although they only have one pair
of formal trousers, they are anxious to make a good impression, so each man occupies a pant leg.
The first of the five plays is called kami-mono
(god play) and involves a deity who descends
to bestow blessings on mortals. The second is shura-mono (warrior play) involving a fallen hero, while in the third type, kazura-mono (woman play), a lovelorn female is wronged or abandoned by her lover. The fourth is monoguri-mono (madness play) in which the protagonist, often a woman, is driven to a deranged state by extreme duress or jealousy. Lastly, in the faster-paced kiri-mono (demon
play), evil beings preside, or sometimes magical animals. Spectators follow scripts, since the archaic language chanted by the chorus is often incomprehensible to modern Japanese audiences.
Noh plays can exist in two temporal planes. Genzai
(realistic) noh involves a living protagonist, who
suffers tremendously from the loss of a spouse or a
child. Their tortured life makes them a deranged outcast who exists in a mortal “limbo” that is close to a death-like state. In mugen (fantasy) noh plots, a sleeping waki sees a ghost in a dream. In a flashback, the shite relives the suffering he or she endured while living, as well as the present agony of their tortured soul, and begs the monk to pray for their salvation. The waki prays until the ghost, set free by prayers, performs a joyful dance and then slowly and silently departs. When the waki awakens, foggy from his dream, it is daytime and the ghost is nowhere to be seen.
